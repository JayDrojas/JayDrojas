Welcome ! 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻, My name is Damian !
</h2>

I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, with a passion for building intuitive, scalable solutions. I thrive on problem-solving, whether it’s tracking down a tricky bug or designing a feature from scratch.

I’m naturally curious and enjoy exploring new technologies, frameworks, and approaches to improve workflows and user experiences. Some of my favorite languages and frameworks include JavaScript, Python, React, and Angular. I also have experience with Docker, AWS, Sequelize, and SQLAlchemy, and I’m always excited to learn more. 

Collaboration is important to me, I’m a committed teammate, patient communicator, and enjoy working in environments where I can contribute to shared success. I’m fluent in English and Spanish, and I love combining my technical skills with creativity to build software that makes an impact. Outside of coding, I enjoy soccer, football, video gaming, and exploring new tech trends. My long-term goal is to work on artificial intelligence and cutting-edge software projects that challenge me to grow as an engineer..

Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS
Frontend: React, Angular, Redux, Next.js, Chakra UI
Backend / Frameworks: Node.js, Express, Flask, Django, .NET, Spring Boot
